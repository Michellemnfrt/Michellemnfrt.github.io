## WEB DEVELOPER

_I have a diverse background that helps me to communicate and understand people. I have studied human nature as well as their desires and concluded that we all just need to be happy. I know that is easier said than done. Luckily, the web makes it easier to connect and teach people ways to facilitate happiness._

## EXPERIENCE

Developed 3 independent Projects:

 **Flash Memory Game:** A combination of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Lodash, are used generate a randomized board of 16 cells with an emoji on the reverse side. The purpose of the game is two exercise one’s memory, When the user clicks on two different cards the emojis appear, if the emoji’s match the cards remain flipped, if they do not match, they flip back over and the face of the card turns gray. The user must try to remember the position of the emoji’s in order to find of the matches. When all of the cells are matched an alert appears and the board regenerates.

 **Muzik Sha.ree App:** For this project I used Express, MongoDB and NodeJS. I used bootstrap to simplify the styling aspect. The purpose of the app is to allow users to create a profile where they can upload independent songs that have not been published yet for consumer feedback. User are able to upload new songs or pre-released music. The app is useful for people trying to make changes before releasing music. It provides independent artists an opportunity to express themselves and connect with each-other.

The purpose of this is app is to help user find recipes and recreate meals from ingredients they already have.
